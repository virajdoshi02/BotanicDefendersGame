**Concept:**

This game is an interesting multiplayer 2D tower defence game developed using Unity, drawing inspiration from the likes of "Plants vs Zombies" and "Overcooked!" What sets this game apart from others in the genre are its unique takes on resource management, time management, cooperation and defence. Moreover, the game has a tense and immersive story that drives its events, and is filled to the brim with captivating, hand-drawn entities that have unique designs and move in different ways.

**My Team:**

I created this game with some help from my group members, Steven, Erica, Eric, Kimberly and Derek.

**My Roles in the process:**

* Design:

  * Game design
  
  * Writing

* Development:

	* Developer
  
	* Game systems developer
  
	* Enemy and plant AI creation

   * Resource management system

<br>

**Challenges:**

* Art bottleneck

  * Our group had one artist and 5 developers, and since all the assets were to be hand-drawn, art became a massive bottleneck. Therefore, some team members began practicing as artists and drawing to speed up the process

<br>

**Assets:**

* All assets were hand drawn by our team's artists
